A sample application that uses an extended version of the routing-jms plugin with an Oracle AQ jms component.

A simple, but non-trivial application
 - camel route that takes a message off an oracle AQ queue
 - transacts the route with a wired transaction policy
 - deserializes using Camel's jaxb component
 - persists a domain object to the same oracle schema using hibernate plugin
 - persists another domain object to a mongo db using the mongo-db plugin
